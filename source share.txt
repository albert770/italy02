While the skill of typography in the work speaks for itself, the website design is definitely not to be ignored either. Considerable space in kerning is use strategically to give weight to a smooth, simple sans serif font. This is coupled with the studio logo which uses an intricate script font alongside curvy and free flowing lines.

Loud, mobile, to the point typography with tight and sensible kerning. Italicization gives a further sense of character and depth. Very much "to the point" - doesn't waste time in saying content is
pay walled.

As a type foundary, the amount of typography here may be overwhelming to some. However, the designers of this site do well to keep the content digestible. Content is well organized and follows a hierarchy which gets user where they want to go. Moving type creates a sense of movement which
engages end user.
